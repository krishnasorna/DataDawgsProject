# Krishna's Work Commits

First I started off by compiling the datasets and making sure all relevant data was used for my section of the final project. I uploaded my CSV files that are most up to date and are able to reproduce the regression analysis that I have done from my side of the project. My main goal for this project was to utilize Lasso Regression to find the selection of the best subset of variables. I felt intriguied to achieve greater prediction accuracy as compared to all of the other regression models and to accumulate the best model for this project. I also wanted to help increase model interpretation by effectively eliminating 10 variables [Player, GS, MIN, FGM, FGP, Three_Pmade, Three_PP, DEF, STL, BLK] in my best model. I have also made sure to visualize the shrinkage in lasso coefficients with increasing values of the tuning parameter lambda to find the optimla tuning parameter.
